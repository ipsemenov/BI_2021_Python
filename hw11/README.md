# HW11 - Working with SQL databases via python
Here we cover the following things:
* Creation of SQL databases
* Selection and insertion of information
* Joining several tables via foreign key and fetching information from them

## Data
We will work with data about SNPs. But initial datasets were too large to upload them on GitHub.<br>
So to run this notebook initial datasets should be downloaded manually via [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWIT8Yn-GdgpBUfFO87dnIDQgmE5nj-j/view?usp=sharing)
and placed in a folder `../data`.
